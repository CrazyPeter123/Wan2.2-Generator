# Wan 2.2 Full Review: What, How, Features, and How to Use (Including Free Online Tool)

## 1. What *Is* Wan 2.2?

**Wan 2.2** is Alibaba Tongyi Lab’s latest open video foundation model, released July 2025.  
It’s a **Mixture-of‑Experts (MoE) diffusion‑transformer** with **27 billion parameters**, while activating only ~14 billion weights per diffusion step—enabling higher capacity at similar GPU cost.  
Shipped under the **Apache‑2.0 licence**, both code and weights can be used commercially with no royalties. 

Unlike closed models (e.g. Sora, Lumiere), Wan 2.2 is fully open‑source and community‑driven. It turns text or image prompts into 24 fps, 720 p cinematic video via open APIs and ready‑built apps.

## 2. Wan 2.2 vs Wan 2.1 — Key Differences

| Feature                   | Wan 2.1 (Feb 2025)                         | Wan 2.2 (Jul 2025)                          | Real‑world benefit                    |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Architecture              | Dense 14 B diffusion transformer           | 2‑expert MoE: 27 B total (14 B active)      | Motion improves, VRAM stays stable    |
| Training data             | ~18 million clips, 480 p                  | +65 % images, +83 % videos, 720 p           | Broader scenes, sharper transitions   |
| Cinematic metadata        | None                                       | Lighting, motion, lens, LUT tags            | Prompt‑faithful color & style         |
| Output resolution         | 480 p                                      | **720 p**                                   | Cleaner rendering, less artifacts     |
| Checkpoints               | T2V‑14 B / TI2V‑1.3 B                     | TI2V‑5 B, I2V‑A14 B, T2V‑A14 B              | Fits more GPU tiers                   |
| Benchmark (FVD)           | ~196                                       | ~148 (≈24 % better)                         | Lower perceptual error                |  


In practice, creators say Wan 2.2 produces smoother camera moves, more accurate object placement (“a red kite flying beside a yellow umbrella”), and richer audiovisual consistency—even when run on the same GPU.

## 3. Signature Features of Wan 2.2

### 3.1 Mixture‑of‑Experts Backbone  
Two expert networks split the denoising task:

- **High‑noise expert** handles early diffusion to sketch global motion and layout  
- **Low‑noise expert** polishes color, edges, and temporal stability in later steps  

Only one expert fires per step—keeping memory usage in line with a 14 B model but delivering quality like a much larger one. 

### 3.2 Cinematic Metadata Tags  
Each training clip is labeled with 20+ properties: lighting mood, motion type (handheld, drone), lens focal length, LUT style, even film stock emulation.  
These tags let prompts like *“handheld 35 mm film grain at dusk, teal‑orange color grade”* result in deterministic, cinematic visuals. 

### 3.3 Lightweight TI2V‑5 B Variant  
The **TI2V‑5 B** checkpoint is a dense 5 B model packaged with the VAE pipeline. It accepts both text and reference images, runs on **8 GB VRAM**, and powers free-tier endpoints. Ideal for hobbyists or lightweight SaaS applications.

### 3.4 Multilingual Text Rendering  
Balanced bilingual (Chinese + English) caption data enables crisp on-screen text in both languages. This supports global marketing use‑cases and bilingual storytelling.

### 3.5 Day‑One Ecosystem Support  
Wan 2.2 launched with fully integrated **ComfyUI** workflows, Hugging Face Diffusers pipelines, and OBS plugin support—plus official FastAPI stubs—making setup as easy as installing templates. 

## 4. How *Wan 2.2* Works (Overview)

1. **Prompt Encoding**  
   A 2 048‑token Transformer‑XL style encoder maps your prompt into semantic embeddings.

2. **Latent Projection**  
   A spatio‑temporal VAE compresses 720 p video grids by 64× to reduce compute overhead.

3. **Expert Routing**  
   A learned signal‑to‑noise threshold decides when to activate the high‑ or low‑noise expert each diffusion timestep.

4. **Denoising Process**  
   ~26–32 diffusion iterations refine the latent, using classifier‑free guidance to adhere to prompt semantics.

5. **Decoding & Upscaling**  
   VAE outputs 24 fps RGB frames; optional ESRGAN or Video‑ESRGAN upscales to 1080 p or higher downstream. 

**Runtime** (on RTX 3090):  
- TI2V‑5 B: ~9 minutes for 5 s at 720 p (≈ 120 frames)  
- T2V‑A14 B: ~18 minutes same clip, but higher quality results.
